<br/>

You must make a plan before you start coding and have a member of the instructional team sign you off.  

<br/>

## **Requirements**
<br/>

* Must implement HTML structure of the wireframe
* Component should be centered on the page
* Add 3 buttons for donations of **£1**, **£5**, and **£10.** Clicking these buttons should donate that amount to the campaign.
* Once the target has been reached, you should no longer be able to accept donations
* As the value changes, through clicks to the donation buttons, or through changes made by the setInterval, the UI **should update accordingly.**

**Bonus tasks:**
* When the page loads, the scrollbar should be animated from 0 to its current value.
* Every 10 seconds, a **random** donation of either **£1**, **£5**, or **£10,** should be made to the campaign. You should use setInterval to implement this.
* Every time a donation is made, a sound plays.
